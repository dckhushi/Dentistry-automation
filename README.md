 🦷 Dentistry Automation

AI-powered multi-agent Voice Automation platform for dental clinics that handles inbound patient calls, insurance verification, claim follow-ups, appointment recalls, and payment collection through real-time conversational AI and adaptive IVR navigation.

Built using FastAPI, Twilio, Deepgram, Cartesia, Redis, PostgreSQL, and Next.js with a scalable, HIPAA-aware architecture designed for real-world healthcare automation.

* Structured PMS-ready outputs

## 📋 Claim Follow-Up Agent

* Checks claim status automatically
* Retrieves denial codes and next actions
* Creates structured AR notes
* Reduces manual insurance follow-up workload

## 🔁 Recall Agent

* Calls overdue patients
* Reminder and rescheduling automation
* Multi-attempt retry logic

## 🧠 Adaptive IVR Learning Engine

One of the core differentiators of the platform.

The system dynamically learns payer IVR phone trees instead of relying on hardcoded flows.

Features include:

* IVR graph-based learning
* DTMF replay optimization
* Confidence scoring
* Reinforcement learning loop
* Payer-specific timing calibration
* Automatic path optimization over time

This significantly reduces:

* Call duration
* LLM usage
* Operational cost
* Manual intervention
